    "The business objective is to find out what the key drivers/factors for used car prices are so that they can adjust their price correctly and make more profitable sales. From a data mining stand point we reframe the task to correctly predict the price of a used car based on our data. If we can train a model that successfully predicts the future price of a car, then we'll have determined what the weights and main factors are that contribute to the modeling. Additionally, we'll be able to establish a certain amount of confidence by testing our models on a training data set using a test-train split."
